# Product Backlog Prioritization and Recommendations

## 1. Prioritized Sprint Features List (Next Sprint)

| Priority | Feature                         | Explanation                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Campaign Wizard Core Flow**   | Enables campaign creation (MVP foundation). Step-by-step UI and budget calculator are critical for user onboarding.  |
| 2        | **Basic Template Engine**       | Profession-specific templates are required for campaign creation. Focus on plumbing/legal/medical starter templates. |
| 3        | **Dashboard Metrics Framework** | Core ROI visualization needed for value demonstration. Start with cost/revenue comparison charts.                    |
| 4        | **Responsive Layout System**    | Mobile-first requirement for service trades. Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox foundation.                                  |
| 5        | **Contact Form Integrator**     | Essential lead capture mechanism. Prioritize 3rd-party service compatibility.                                        |

## 2. Feature Explanations

1. **Campaign Wizard**

    - _Why_: Directly enables primary use case (campaign creation)
    - _Scope_: Minimum viable version with budget calculator and directory integration stubs

2. **Template Engine**

    - _Why_: Profession-specificity is key differentiator
    - _Scope_: 3 base templates with color scheme customization (no full editor yet)

3. **Dashboard Framework**

    - _Why_: Required to demonstrate platform ROI value
    - _Scope_: Static data visualization first (live data integration in next sprint)

4. **Responsive Layout**

    - _Why_: Target users (tradespeople) heavily mobile-dependent
    - _Scope_: Mobile breakpoints for core components + testing matrix

5. **Contact Form System**
    - _Why_: Lead conversion dependency
    - _Scope_: Form builder UI + 2 major email service integrations

## 3. Suggested Improvements

- **Immediate**:

    - Add campaign template preview functionality
    - Implement dashboard data caching strategy

- **Future**:
    - Tooltip glossary system for marketing terms
    - Campaign duplication feature
    - Template version control

## 4. Identified Risks

| Risk                               | Mitigation Strategy                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Complex campaign state management  | Prototype Context API structure early     |
| Template customization scope creep | Lock template fields post sprint planning |
| Mobile layout testing overhead     | Implement device lab automation early     |
| API integration delays             | Use mock services for initial development |

## 5. Team Recommendations

1. **Architecture**:

    - Implement CampaignContext before wizard development
    - Standardize theme.js usage across components

2. **Performance**:

    - Set up image optimization pipeline early
    - Implement lazy loading boundaries in dashboard

3. **Testing**:

    - Prioritize Cypress component testing for wizard steps
    - Validate responsive layouts against real mobile devices

4. **Documentation**:
    - Create template schema documentation
    - Maintain styleguide for profession-specific theming

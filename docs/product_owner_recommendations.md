   services._

3. **Template Customization System**  
   _Differentiator for target professions. Blocking client onboarding for early testers._

4. **Contact Form Integration Engine**  
   _High client demand feature per discovery interviews. Reduces third-party dependencies._

  Interactive tutorial for non-technical users showing campaign creation flow

- **Template A/B Testing**  
  Allow users to test multiple template variations with automatic performance reporting

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Technical Debt       | Context API scalability for campaign state     | Schedule spike to evaluate Redux migration |
| Third-Party Reliance | Google My Business API rate limits             | Develop fallback caching layer             |
| UX Complexity        | Dashboard information overload risk            | Conduct usability testing with real users  |
| Performance          | Chart rendering bottlenecks on low-end devices | Implement Web Workers for data processing  |

## 5. Team Recommendations

1. **Adopt Feature Flags**  
   For campaign wizard and dashboard features to enable incremental rollout

2. **Establish Baseline Metrics**  
   Define performance budgets:

    - Dashboard load time < 2s on 3G
    - First Contentful Paint < 1s

3. **Prioritize Error Tracking**  
   Implement Sentry/Rollbar early given complex form interactions

4. **Conduct Template Accessibility Audit**  
   Ensure WCAG AA compliance for medical/legal verticals

5. **Schedule Integration Testing Window**  
   Block time for end-to-end testing with directory APIs before sprint end

**Recommended Sprint Success Criteria:**  
✓ 3 local business test campaigns created via wizard
